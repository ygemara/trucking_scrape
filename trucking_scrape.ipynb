If I fall asleep and fail to respond when they call over the CB radio, the yardhostler driver pulls the trailer, and stages it in their empty trailer area.   When I pulled for JB Hunt eons ago (during the Cretaceous Period, when cabover trucks dominated most fleets, and JB drivers were Public Enemy number 1 to other drivers),  I noticed most drivers took a long time, while the giant carriers like myself, Schneider, and Werner (Swift and Knight had not yet existed) were leaving the exit gate 2 hours after they had arrived.  My load was suppose to be a drop-n-hook, but I couldn't find an empty trailer.

It was 24 pallets (full truckload) of perishable yogurt.   As I drove out the exit gate, I was thinking \"any moment now, I should wake up to find I've fallen asleep in the sleeper, and I'm still waiting at the docks.\"   When I bragged over the CB radio I had gotten out of there in record time, all the drivers replied \"You f-a-g-g-o-t !!! Whose d*ck did you suck to get out of here so fast !!??\"  One driver replied \"I'm a good buddy!  Who should I service to get out of here faster??\" \n",

Ever since then when I get dispatched there I stop before I get there and put the girls in the cage and then put them in the bunk where they're out of sight so that way I don't get any hassles from the guards!

Then every time after that he addressed me by name, \"Scott, please back into door #\" etc. Once I was backed into the door, I walked in and he said \"Scott, sorry, but we require you to wait by your door while being unloaded\" Then they had 24 skids unloaded within half hour, unloaded, counted, and scanned. Once the last skid came off the truck, I had my paper work in hand, and was on my way to my next stop.\n",

      " I used to deliver mainly cheese products when leaving my base in northern Utah which was mostly dairy farms, so of course went to a lot of Mc Donalds warehouses quite frequently mainly in Los Angeles, and Phoenix, I always found them to be very quick they were more strict when it came to checking the security seals on the doors though for bio security reasons, yes Cosco were fine, Albertsens were ok as well, come to think of it I never really got stuffed around, in fact I can only think of one time where I had to go to some no name back water place in CA south of Sacramento it was a Hot load and I only missed the delivery time by a few hours the dock shut at 12 pm they made me wait for 2 whole days, before unloading me. It does make me wonder if they needed the product 2 days earlier why they then made me wait for 2 days, total spite if you ask me if only they knew the trouble I went to driving there. After that I refused to do any hot loads and this was if fact the one only load I was ever late delivering too.\n",
